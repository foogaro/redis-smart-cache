{product-name} is a JDBC query cache for https://redis.io/docs/stack/[Redis Stack], https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/[Redis Cloud], and https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-software/overview/[Redis Enterprise].

{product-name} is implemented as a JDBC driver and acts as a wrapper around any backend database JDBC driver.
Repeated identical queries are answered from Redis, bypassing the backend database and often greatly
 improving overall response time.

== Background

Redis is an in-memory data store designed to serve data with the fastest possible response times.
For this reason, Redis is frequently used for caching OLTP-style application queries like SQL.
Implementing a caching solution is usually not trivial.
Among other things it involves:
* Fault-tolerance
* Result-set serialization and deserialization
* Cache invalidation: dynamic configuration, exclude/include rules, ...

We built {product-name} so that an existing JDBC application can take advantage of Redis as a cache without any code change, just configuration changes.

== Quick start

To understand how {product-name} works, it's best to try it for yourself.
This example showcases an application that continuously performs queries against a MySQL database and uses {product-name} to cache query results.

Follow the steps below:

First, clone this git repository:
[source,console,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
git clone {project-url}.git
cd {project-name}
----

Next, use Docker Compose to launch containers for MySQL, Grafana, Redis Stack, and {product-name) example app instance:
[source,console]
----
docker-compose up
----

When all containers have started log into Grafana: http://localhost:3000

Username / password: `admin` / `admin`

In the Grafana UI click on http://localhost:3000/datasources/new?utm_source=grafana_gettingstarted[Add your first datasource].

In the filter box enter `Redis` and click on the first entry (*Redis datasource*).

In the wizard that shows up, enter `redis://redis:6379` for the Redis address and click on `Save & test`.

Now import the demo dashboard by clicking on Dashboards/Import in the sidebar.

image::{grafana-dir}/import-dashboard.png[Import Dashboard,width=200]

Click on `Upload JSON file` and upload `{project-name}/demo/redis-sidecar-demo/grafana/dashboard.json`.
At the bottom of the page select the Redis datasource that you previously created and click `Import`.

You should see the following dashboard:

image::{grafana-dir}/dashboard.png[Dashboard,width=400]

After a few minutes the Redis cache will be populated and you should see dramatically improved response times.

== Installation

Add the {product-name} JDBC driver as an application dependency.

.Maven
[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>{project-group}</groupId>
    <artifactId>{artifact-id}</artifactId>
    <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

.Gradle
[source,groovy,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
dependencies {
    implementation '{project-group}:{artifact-id}:{project-version}'
}
----

== Usage

=== Configuration
When the {product-name} driver is initialized by your application it needs to know at the very least how to connect to the Redis database.
This is called bootstrap configuration and can be achieved with the following parameters in your application: 

Driver class name:: `com.redis.sidecar.SidecarDriver`

JDBC URL:: `jdbc:redis://...` - see https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/wiki/Redis-URI-and-connection-details#uri-syntax[here] for details on the Redis URI syntax.

Once connected, {product-name} read its configuration from the JSON document located under `sidecar:config`.
If that document does not yet exist it is possible to populate it at startup with the following JDBC properties.

==== Backend Database
`sidecar.driver.class-name`:: Class name of the backend database JDBC driver

`sidecar.driver.url`:: JDBC URL for the backend database

You can also include any property your backend JDBC driver requires, like `username` or `password`.
These will be passed to the backend JDBC driver as is.

==== Redis
The following properties can be used to configure Redis connections and storage:

`sidecar.redis.uri`:: Redis URI. See https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/wiki/Redis-URI-and-connection-details#uri-syntax[here] for syntax.

`sidecar.redis.cluster`:: Set to `true` for Redis Cluster connections (default: `false`)

`sidecar.redis.tls`:: Establish a secure TLS connection.

`sidecar.redis.insecure`:: Allow insecure TLS connection by skipping cert validation.

`sidecar.redis.username`:: Used to send ACL style 'AUTH username pass'. Overrides username in Redis URI. Needs password.

`sidecar.redis.password`:: Password to use when connecting to the server. Overrides password in Redis URI.

`sidecar.redis.keyspace`:: Prefix for all Redis keys used by Sidecar like cache entries, configuration, and metrics (default: `sidecar`)

`sidecar.redis.key-separator`:: Delimiter to use between key elements (default: `:`).

`sidecar.redis.pool.max-active`:: Maximum number of connections that can be allocated by the pool at a given time (default: `8`). Use a negative value for no limit.

`sidecar.redis.pool.max-idle`:: Maximum number of "idle" connections in the pool (default: `8`). Use a negative value to indicate an unlimited number of idle connections.

`sidecar.redis.pool.min-idle`:: Target for the minimum number of idle connections to maintain in the pool (default: `0`). This setting only has an effect if both it and time between eviction runs are positive.

`sidecar.redis.pool.max-wait`:: Maximum amount of time in milliseconds a connection allocation should block before throwing an exception when the pool is exhausted (default: `-1`). Use a negative value to block indefinitely.

`sidecar.redis.pool.time-between-eviction-runs`:: Time in milliseconds between runs of the idle object evictor thread (default: `-1`). When positive, the idle object evictor thread starts, otherwise no idle object eviction is performed.

`sidecar.redis.buffer-size`:: Maximum capacity in MB of the buffer used to encode a resultset (default: `100`).

==== Rules
{product-name} uses rules to determine how SQL queries are cached.
Rules are processed in order and consist of *criteria* (conditions) and *actions* (results):

* Criteria

`table`:: matches if given name is present in the query tables (default: `null`). Use null (empty) value to match all tables. 

* Action

`ttl`:: Key expiration duration in seconds (default: `3600`). Use `0` for no caching, `-1` for no expiration.
