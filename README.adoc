{product-name} is a JDBC query cache for https://redis.io/docs/stack/[Redis Stack], https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/[Redis Cloud], and https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-software/overview/[Redis Enterprise].

{product-name} lets you adds caching to your application without changing any lines of code.

Implemented as a wrapper around your backend database's JDBC driver, {product-name} can answer
slow, repeated queries from Redis, bypassing expensive database calls and often greatly
improving response times.

== Background

Redis is an in-memory data store designed to serve data with the fastest possible response times.
For this reason, Redis is frequently used for caching.

It's not always easy to modify your code to utilize Redis as a cache. You need to think about a number of issues, including:

* Result set serialization and deserialization
* Fault-tolerance
* Cache invalidation

This is why we built {product-name}. After adding a single dependency and setting some basic configuration, your JDBC application can take advantage of Redis as a cache without any code changes.

== Quick start

To understand how {product-name} works, it's best to try it for yourself.

This example showcases an application that continuously performs queries against a MySQL database and uses {product-name} to cache query results.

Follow the steps below:

First, clone this git repository:
[source,console,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
git clone {project-url}.git
cd {project-name}
----

Next, use Docker Compose to launch containers for MySQL, Grafana, Redis Stack, and {product-name) example app instance:
[source,console]
----
docker-compose up
----

Once all of these containers have started, log in to Grafana by pointing your browser to http://localhost:3000. Use the following credentials:

Username: `admin`
Password: `admin`

In the Grafana UI, click http://localhost:3000/datasources/new?utm_source=grafana_gettingstarted[Add your first datasource].

In the filter box, enter `Redis` and click on the first entry (*Redis datasource*).

In the wizard that shows up, enter `redis://redis:6379` for the Redis address and click `Save & test`.

Now import the demo dashboard by clicking `Dashboards/Import` in the sidebar.

image::{grafana-dir}/import-dashboard.png[Import Dashboard,width=200]

Next, click `Upload JSON file` and upload `{project-name}/demo/redis-sidecar-demo/grafana/dashboard.json`.

At the bottom of the page select the Redis datasource that you previously created and click `Import`.

You should see the following dashboard:

After a few minutes, the Redis cache will be populated and you should see dramatically improved response times.

== Installation

Add the {product-name} JDBC driver as an application dependency.

.Maven
[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>{project-group}</groupId>
    <artifactId>{artifact-id}</artifactId>
    <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

.Gradle
[source,groovy,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
dependencies {
    implementation '{project-group}:{artifact-id}:{project-version}'
}
----

== Usage

=== Configuration

First, ensure that your application is using {product-name} as its JDBC driver:

Driver class name:: `com.redis.sidecar.SidecarDriver`

Next, set your JDBC URL to the URI for your Redis instance. For example:

JDBC URL:: `jdbc:redis://cache.redis.cloud:6379`

See https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/wiki/Redis-URI-and-connection-details#uri-syntax[Lettuce's URI syntax]

Once connected, {product-name} reads its configuration from a Redis JSON document located under `sidecar:config`.

If that document does not yet exist, you can populate it at startup with the following JDBC properties.

==== Backend database
`sidecar.driver.class-name`:: Class name of the backend database JDBC driver

`sidecar.driver.url`:: JDBC URL for the backend database

You can also include any property your backend JDBC driver requires, like `username` or `password`.
These will be passed to the backend JDBC driver as is.

==== Redis
To further configure how {product-name} connects to Redis, use the following properties:

`sidecar.redis.uri`:: Redis URI. See the https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/wiki/Redis-URI-and-connection-details#uri-syntax[Lettuce Redis URI] for syntax for what's permitted here.

`sidecar.redis.cluster`:: Set to `true` for Redis Cluster connections (default: `false`).

`sidecar.redis.tls`:: Establish a secure TLS connection.

`sidecar.redis.insecure`:: Allow insecure TLS connection by skipping cert validation.

`sidecar.redis.username`:: Authenticate using the provided username. Overrides username in Redis URI. Requires password.

`sidecar.redis.password`:: Authenticate using the provided password. Overrides password in Redis URI.

`sidecar.redis.keyspace`:: Prefix for all Redis keys used by Sidecar, such as cache entries, configuration, and metrics. (default: `sidecar`)

`sidecar.redis.key-separator`:: Delimiter to use between key elements (default: `:`).

`sidecar.redis.pool.max-active`:: Maximum number of connections that can be allocated by the pool at a given time (default: `8`). Use a negative value for no limit.

`sidecar.redis.pool.max-idle`:: Maximum number of "idle" connections in the pool (default: `8`). Use a negative value to indicate an unlimited number of idle connections.

`sidecar.redis.pool.min-idle`:: Target for the minimum number of idle connections to maintain in the pool (default: `0`). This setting only has an effect if both it and time between eviction runs are positive.

`sidecar.redis.pool.max-wait`:: Maximum amount of time in milliseconds a connection allocation should block before throwing an exception when the pool is exhausted (default: `-1`). Use a negative value to block indefinitely.

`sidecar.redis.pool.time-between-eviction-runs`:: Time in milliseconds between runs of the idle object evictor thread (default: `-1`). When positive, the idle object evictor thread starts; otherwise no idle object eviction is performed.

`sidecar.redis.buffer-size`:: Maximum capacity, in MB, of the buffer used to encode a result set (default: `100`).

==== Rules
{product-name} uses rules to determine how SQL queries are cached.

Rules are processed in order and consist of *criteria* (conditions) and *actions* (results):

* Criteria

`table`:: matches if given name is present in the query tables (default: `null`). Use null (empty) value to match all tables. 

* Action

`ttl`:: Key expiration duration in seconds (default: `3600`). Use `0` for no caching, `-1` for no expiration.
